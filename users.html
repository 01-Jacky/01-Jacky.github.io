    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <h3>User Interview</h3>

    <p>3 Interviews were given: 1 student and 2 software engineers in the industry.
      These interviews helped understand who the users are and if they have the skills to work at their company.
      They highly valued being able to see projects and experience on a portfolio website.
      They also want to be able to gauge the personality and passion of the person on the website.
    </p>
    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>

    <p>In order to develop a portfolio that is competitive with other peers, 4 competitors' websites were analyzed consisting of
       students or software engineers in the industry. The competitors all have project section that directly linked to the source code.
      Each competitor also had interesting design that catches the eye with good use of color scheme and images.
    </p>
    <h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>

    <p>The feature value matrix helped quantify the significance of each feature from the perspective of the user, the business
      (in this case me), and the dev effort.
      Most features have similar user value and business value.
      The features that takes the most dev effort is developing a project page and improving the look and design of the site.
      </p>
    <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>

    <p>
        These charts helped identify what features are most important to work on next and what the low hanging fruits are.
        From the chart of the Kano Model, all the basic feature and some performance feature has already been implemented.
        The focus now should be include some nice to have features such as the project section.

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <h3>User Stories</h3>

    <p>Each epic roughly mapped to each feature to help give context to why the features exist. In most stories, the user type
      were either a HR recruiter or hiring manager. Many of the successful outcome is being able to access the skills, experience, projects,
      and source code on the portfolio.
    </p>
    <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>

    <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4nR9EPUPLBrclNSajU0cHNSZjA">Link to document on Google Drive</a></p>
    <p>Each walkthrough helped get inside the users head while they were using the portfolio site. 3 walkthrough were conducted.
      Some common observation was too much text to read, and boring design. The project summary feature had mixed comments; one user
      thought it was very good while others said it was too much to read.
    </p>
    <h3>User Test</h3>

    <p><a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/24a65e91487b/results">Link to Question Test</a></p>
    <p>A question test was conducted to gauge which part of the site was most important and what can be improved. Feedback suggested the experience
      section was most important and the overall design of the site was between neutral and good. User have reiterated a desire for a project section.
    </p>

    <p>A click test was conducted to ensure the "project summary" button on the experience page was easy to find. Result was most users
    succeeded in getting to the right place.</p>

    <h2>Summary of Finding</h2>
    <p>Most users found the sections of the site to be obvious and easy to get to. They did not have major complain about the look of the site but noted that it could be better. Users did not find any bugs with the function or look of the sites. Users were happy with the feature of being able to click on a button in one of my experience to learn more about what I did during that particular internship experience.</p>
    <p>
      The main concern from user interviews and cognitive walkthrough were the lack of a project section. The users that go on my site are typically concerned about my skill level. While the existing experience page and skills page help give user some idea of my skill level, the lack of a project section was reiterated throughout user interview, competitor analysis, and user testing. Users expects and highly value the a project section that briefly describe a project I worked on, and link to the source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other concern was that while most users found the design to be easy to user and navigate, they also found the aesthetic to be lackluster. Competitor analysis suggested
      the site can benefit from better use of color schemes and interesting imagery. Some users commented that some sections of the site were also too text heavy and wish some of the text can be replaced or supplemented with some images.

    <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
    <p>Based on user research and testing, there plan is to take these two immediate action that will greatly improve the value of the site to the user:</p>
    <p>1) Add a new project section. From user interviews and cognitive walkthrough, users highly value being able to see some projects the person has worked on and being able to view the source code to them. In some ways they were disappointed that it wasn't there. In the future, this section should be added and highlight some interesting projects, sample image(s) of the project in action, a short description,
    and most importantly link the source code of it. This feature will bring the portfolio much closer to the level of the some of the portfolio analyzed during competitors analysis.</p>
    <p>2) Improve the design of the site by changing the color scheme and adding more images. While users found current design and look to be satisfactory, it was also very uninspired. It is missing the wow factor that some of the competitor's website has when you first land on it. Users also complained how sections are too text heavy sections, and so in the future the text should be reduced and/or accompanied by related images. The site will also be redesigned to take on more interesting color schemes and/or layout in order to deliver that wow factor when the user first sees it.
    </p>
    <p>Incorporating the 2 changes (Future): </p>
    <p>1) A new project section will be added to the nav bar. This new section should highlight at least 3 projects with link to the source code on github. If it is a web project, an additional link should be placed to see the project in action. Each project should an interesting image that gives an idea of what the project is about in addition to a short description. As I complete more projects, perhaps setup each project in a grid similar to the skill section.</p>
    <p>2) Redesign: First use a color scheme designer to identify a more interesting color scheme. A website like <a href="http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF">paletton</a> will help with the process. Then explore a new layout. Some idea include a one page layout, or the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/design/language/framework/visual/layout/">golden ratio layout from the ibm design language</a>. Also refactor the text on the About page to be more concise.  </p>
