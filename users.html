    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <h3>User Interview</h3>
    <p>Helped understand who the users are and what they looked for. 3 Interviews were given: 1 student and 2 software engineers in the industry.
      Users highly valued being able to see projects and experience on a portfolio website. They also want to be able to gauge the personality
      and passion of the person on the website.
    </p>
    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
    <p>In order to develop a portfolio that is competitive with other peers, competitor analysis was conducted. 4 competitors were analyzed that
      were students or software engineers in the industry. The competitors all have project section that directly linked to the source code.
      Each competitor also had interesting design that catches the eye with good use of color scheme and images.
    </p>
    <h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
      <p>Helped quantify the significance of each feature from the perspective of the user, the business (in this case me), and the dev effort.
        Most features have similar user value and business value. The features that takes the most dev effort is developing a project page and
        improving the look and design of the site.
      </p>
    <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
      <p>
        These charts helped identify what features are most important to work on next and what the low hanging fruits are.
        From the chart of the Kano Model, all the basic feature and some performance feature has already been implemented.
        The focus now should be include some nice to have features such as the project section.
      </p>

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <h3>User Stories</h3>
    <p>Each epic roughly mapped to each feature to help give context to why the features exist. In most stories, the user type
      were either a HR recruiter or hiring manager. Many of the successful outcome is being able to access the skills, experience, projects,
      and source code on the portfolio.
    </p>
    <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
    <p>Each walkthrough helped get inside the users head while they were using the portfolio site. 3 walkthrough were conducted.
      Some common observation was too much text to read, and boring design. The project summary feature had mixed comments; one user
      thought it was very good while others said it was too much to read.
    </p>
    <h3>User Test</h3>
    <p>A question test was conducted to gauge which part of the site was most important and what can be improved. Feedback suggested the experience
      section was most important and the overall design of the site was between neutral and good. User have reiterated a desire for a project section.
    </p>

    <p>A click test was conducted to ensure the "project summary" button on the experience page was easy to find. Result was most users
    succeeded in getting to the right place.</p>

    <h2>Summary of Finding</h2>
    <p>Most users found the sections of the site to be obvious and easy to get to. The major pain points of the site was the lack of a
    projection section and lackluster design</p>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>The inclusion of a project section was reiterated throughout user interview, competitor analysis, and user testing. Adding a project section
      that briefly describe a project I worked on, and link to the source code, will be highly valued by the users.
    </p>
    <p>
      While most users found the design to be easy to navigate, they also found the aesthetic to be lackluster. Competitor analysis suggested
      the site can benefit from better use of color schemes and interesting imagery. Some sections of the site were also too text heavy.

    <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
    <p>There are two immediate action to take that can greatly improve the value of the site to the user:</p>
    <p>1) Add a new project section. Users highly value being able to see some projects the person has worked on and being able to view the source
    code to them. This section should highlight some interesting projects, include some interesting images associated with it, a short description,
    and link the source code of it.</p>
    <p>2) Improve the design of the site by changing the color scheme and adding more images. The current text heavy sections should be reduced
      and accompanied by related images.
