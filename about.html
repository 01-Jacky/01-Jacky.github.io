    I'm a junior studying computer science at University of California. Aside from school I focus on applying my skills
    working in internships at places like NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA Glenn Research Center, and ViaSat.
    I plan on graduating in summer 2018 and currently looking for a summer 2017 software engineering internship.

  <p>
    I am proficient with C#, Java, Python, Javascript, and C++ (in the order of experience).
    I've worked with large Microsoft SQL server to set up new tables schemas, write optimized queries, and create
    useful stored procedures.
    I've also had backend web development experience using the .NET framework.
    Productivity wise I worked on teams that followed Scrum and Git for version control.
  </p>
  <p>My current interest is data engineering and backend data services. I also have an interest in data analytics using
    machine learning or data mining, but without knowing how to engineer data pipelines then data analytics is not
    possible. Therefore I am currently learning about building scalable databases, big data platforms (Hadoop MongoDB),
    cloud infrastructure and orchestration, and building RESTful API's.
